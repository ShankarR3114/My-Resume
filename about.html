<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I’m a passionate and purpose-driven B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering (AI & ML, 2024–2028)
   student, on a mission to grow into a high-impact developer. With a foundation in C programming,
   I’ve built a **Medical Shop Billing System, and I’m currently enhancing my Python (intermediate)
   and Java (beginner) skills. I’m also diving deep into full-stack web development through 
   Dr. Angela Yu’s comprehensive Udemy bootcamp, where I recently built my own HTML-based resume 
   website as a capstone.My interest doesn't stop at code — I’m deeply committed to discipline,
   daily self-growth, and turning long-term goals into tangible outcomes. Whether it’s building smart 
   solutions like my Python-based password security system, or learning new technologies like RESTful APIs, 
   I believe in creating work that’s not only functional but meaningful.This portfolio reflects more 
   than just my skillset — it’s a glimpse into who I am becoming: a curious learner, a disciplined builder, 
   and a future-ready engineer ready to contribute, collaborate, and innovate.
